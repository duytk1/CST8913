1. **What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?**

As a payment authorizer and provider service from Uruguay, TotalNet is a company that is focused on improving technology in the quality of its services, as well as ensuring the customers can securely perform their operations with trust and reliability. That is why TotalNet aims to migrate to the cloud and improve upon its infrastructure.

2. **What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?**

The most pressing question I would love to know about the infrastructure of the company is how large it is, as knowing this information also lets us know the expected user base of the company and how much they would need to allocate for the resources to the cloud. Also we must be able to know their main location of operation so that we can best create resources and serve their customers in a timely manner.

3. **Produce a RACI matrix for the migration stakeholders**

| Activity | TotalNet | Microsoft Azure | Internal DevOps | Customer |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Plan cloud migration | A | I | R | I |
| Implement Azure Active Directory | A | C | R | I |
| Ensure cloud compliance | C | R | R | I |
| Adopt Azure tools | A | C | C | I |
| Future support | A | I | R | I |

4. **Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company.**

We would suggest that they proceed with the Refactor approach using PaaS for the migration since they already have the physical infrastructure for their operation so that will make the migration process much smoother and easier since they can reuse their assets. PaaS would also mean that they can use their existing devices and development tools as well as their business intelligence services for the migration.

5. **Produce a high level schedule for the migration process**

The schedule for the migration process is described as follows:

* Plan: The company would assess the necessity of migrating their services to the cloud. They need to identify the reasons for moving to the cloud, including supporting the growing user base and improving the speediness and availability of their services.  
* Ready: Since they already have their own infrastructure, so they need to make sure the integration with Azure is as planned with its many tools. They need to make sure every component of their service is working as expected.  
* Adopt: As the company would have successfully adopted Azure into their business, they need to look into the future in expanding the services and utilizing the resources that Azure has offered.  
6. **What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?**

As they have stated, security is the most important criteria in making decisions for TotalNet as they have been facing issues with security for a long time with their legacy system. After migrating to the cloud with Azure they have been able to support millions of users along with billions of authentications per day. It provided the flexibility much needed to expand and improve their business as they grow over time.  
Another decision making criteria TotalNet had was that the migration to the cloud with Azure also allowed them to separate the external customer database from their existing internal database, enabling the users to take control of their services if needed.
