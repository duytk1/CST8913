1. Key similarities and differences between equivalent services from the three cloud providers.

Compute services: AWS EC2, Azure VMs, and GCP Compute Engine all offer scalable virtual machines. AWS provides more instance types, Azure integrates with Hyper-V, GCP allows custom machine configurations and live VM migration.

Storage services: AWS S3, Azure Blob, and GCP Cloud Storage are all scalable. AWS offers S3 Select for querying, Azure integrates with Data Lake, and GCP streamlines transitions between storage classes.

Database services: AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, and GCP Cloud SQL all support MySQL and PostgreSQL. AWS has the broadest range of engines, Azure features Hyperscale, GCP emphasizes ease of use.

Kubernetes: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, and GCP GKE all manage Kubernetes clusters. AWS integrates with Fargate, Azure with Active Directory, GCPâ€™s GKE Autopilot simplifies operations.

2. Unique features or capabilities:

AWS: There are many features like S3 Select which allows querying data within S3, and Lambda Layers to reuse code. The S3 database provides a relational database engine that's compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL. There is also EKS for controlling container management and integration with other AWS services.

Azure: Azure offers databases within Azure SQL which are designed for big workloads with scaling capabilities. With AKS Dev Spaces we have development and testing in Kubernetes environments.

GCP: GCP has VM migration which allows VMs to be moved between hosts without downtime. It also offers sustained-use discounts that automatically lower costs for sustained workloads. GKE Autopilot simplifies Kubernetes operations by automating cluster management tasks and GCP is integrated with Kubernetes.

3. Naming conventions:

AWS: AWS uses specific names such as EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for virtual machines, S3 (Simple Storage Service) for object storage, RDS (Relational Database Service) for managed databases. 

Azure: Azure has a lot of Azure in its' services name, followed by the service name that describes it such as Azure VM, Azure Vnet.

GCP: Google Cloud uses a mix of "Cloud" branding and unique names, such as Cloud Storage for object storage and Compute Engine for VMs.
