# Migration Project Milestones

## Milestone 1: Environment Setup
- **Task:** Install VMware Workstation and create a new VM.  
- **Objective:** Prepare a VM environment on your local system.  
- **Expected Outcome:** Successfully install and configure VMware Workstation and launch a VM instance.  

## Milestone 2: OS Installation
- **Task:** Install Windows Server OS on the VM.  
- **Objective:** Set up a Windows Server instance as the primary VM environment for migration.  
- **Expected Outcome:** A running Windows Server OS with initial configurations complete.  

## Milestone 3: Application Deployment
- **Task:** Deploy a “Hello World” web application on the Windows Server.  
- **Objective:** Test basic server and network functionality.  
- **Expected Outcome:** The “Hello World” application should be accessible via a web browser within the VM network.  

## Milestone 4: Migration Assessment
- **Task:** Use Azure Migrate to perform an assessment of the VM for migration readiness.  
- **Objective:** Evaluate the VM’s compatibility with Azure and note any necessary adjustments.  
- **Expected Outcome:** A complete migration readiness assessment report, identifying compatibility issues and recommendations.  

## Milestone 5: VM Migration Execution
- **Task:** Migrate the VM to Azure using Azure Migrate tools.  
- **Objective:** Complete the VM migration to Azure and set up the necessary resources for it to run in the cloud.  
- **Expected Outcome:** The VM instance should be successfully migrated to Azure, with all required configurations applied.  

## Milestone 6: Validation and Failover Testing
- **Task:** Validate the migrated VM's functionality by accessing the “Hello World” application in Azure. Then, conduct a failover test.  
- **Objective:** Ensure the application runs as expected post-migration and that failover mechanisms work effectively.  
- **Expected Outcome:** Verification that the “Hello World” application is functional in Azure and resilient to failover scenarios.
